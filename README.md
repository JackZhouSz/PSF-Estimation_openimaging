We introduce a two-step point spread function (PSF) estimation framework. The first step is dedicated to learning spatially variant monochromatic aberration by aligning with the measured spatial frequency response curves. The second step focuses on learning PSF shifts across channels, utilizing the measured chromatic area difference data.
